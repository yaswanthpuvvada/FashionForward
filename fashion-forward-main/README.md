FashionForward is a cutting-edge web application that reimagines the intersection of ecommerce and community support, allowing users not only to purchase high-quality clothing
but also to donate gently used garments to registered NGOs. Designed with a mobile-first
philosophy, the platform leverages a React frontend styled with Tailwind CSS to deliver a
seamless, responsive user experience across devices. Behind the scenes, a Node.js/Express API
Gateway orchestrates secure interactions between the client and a suite of modular backend
services. All transactional and relational data—ranging from user profiles to product
inventories and donation records—is managed by PostgreSQL, ensuring consistency,
reliability, and ease of maintenance. By combining modern web technologies with a robust
data layer, FashionForward provides a stable foundation for both retail transactions and
charitable giving.
The heart of FashionForward lies in its three dedicated dashboards, each tailored to a
distinct user role: customers, sellers, and NGOs. The Customer Dashboard offers browsing,
filtering, and purchase workflows, complete with cart management, order tracking, and
return/refund requests. The Seller Dashboard empowers vendors to add, update, and remove
product listings, as well as to process incoming orders and oversee return authorizations. The
NGO Dashboard simplifies charitable operations, enabling nonprofit organizations to register,
create targeted clothing requests, and monitor request fulfillment. This role-based design
ensures that each stakeholder interacts only with the features relevant to their needs, reducing
complexity and streamlining their respective workflows.
